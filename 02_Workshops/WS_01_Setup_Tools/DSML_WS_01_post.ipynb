Python is widely used for data processing and analysis both in academia and in industry. There is a vibrant and growing scientific community, working at both universities and companies, that supports and enhances its capabilities for data analysis by providing new and refining existing extensions (a.ka.a. libraries, see below). All of this means that, whether you are thinking of continuing in Higher Education or trying to find a job in industry, Python will be an importan asset that employers will significantly value.\n",

This is in contrast to \"low-level\" programming languages, which first need to be converted into machine code (i.e. compiled) before they can be run. With Python, one does not need to worry about compilation and can just write code, evaluate, fix it, re-evaluate it, etc. in a quick cycle, making it a very productive tool.

Encapsulating these atomic bits of functionality in methods allows us to write things once and flexibly use them everywhere, saving us time (and headaches) in the long run."
