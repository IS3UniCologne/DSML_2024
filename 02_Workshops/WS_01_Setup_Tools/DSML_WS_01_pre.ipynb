    "If you read this, you managed to find our GitHub repository for DSML - good job! Git is an open-source distributed version-control system. This repository hosted on GitHub allows us to share code, small data snippets, course information etc. with you. For each workshop there will be a so-called Juypter notebook (like this one), which you can find in the [02_Workshops](../02_Workshops) folder. You need to be able to work with materials shared via this repository on your local machine. There are different ways of doing this:\n",
    "1. *Least set-up time but also least convenient*: access the repository main page (https://github.com/IS3UniCologne/DSML_2024) and **download the repository by clicking on the green Code button on the main page, then *Download ZIP***. Disadvantage: You have to do this whenever there is a new file shared via the repository.\n",
    "2. *A little more set-up time but more convenient*: **Clone the repository to your local machine**. Cloning means that you create a copy of the repository available on GitHub on your local machine. Once you have cloned it, you can easily refresh to get the latest changes using simple commands. To do this, there are two ways:\n",
    "    1. Install GitHub Desktop as explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/setting-up-github-desktop) and clone the repository as explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).\n",
    "    2. First, check if git command line tools are installed on your machine. You can do this by opening up a terminal window in Linux or Mac, or a command prompt window in Windows, and typing the command `git --version` and hit enter. If you get a version number returned, git is installed and you can proceed. If you get an error, you first need to install git as explained [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). Second, once git is installed you can clone the repository as explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=webui).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Once you have cloned the repository successfully, you can simply copy any changes in the \"remote repository\" (this is what we call the version hosted on GitHub) by clicking on Fetch origin and (if there are any changes) Pull origin if you are using GitHub Desktop, or by opening your terminal or command prompt, navigating to the local repository folder (using `cd ...`) and typing `git pull`.\n",
    "3. *Most set-up time but also most convenient*: **Use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice**. Software like Visual Studio Code provides an intuitive user interface, significantly speeds up working with Jupyter notebooks, and integrates seamlessly with Git. You can familiarize yourself and get started with VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) and learn more about how to work with Git in VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever option you choose, you should now be able to access files from the DSML 2024 GitHub Repository on your local machine."
