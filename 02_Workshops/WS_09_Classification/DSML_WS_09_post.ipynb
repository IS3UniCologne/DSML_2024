    "Whereas our previous introduction to machine learning focused on the case of predicting real-valued outputs (called the regression setting), these notes consider the case of predicting discrete-valued outputs. This is called the classification setting. And while it may seem as though this would require very different techniques to handle (after all, the regression setting we just considered made very \"continuous\" predictions rather than discrete ones), one nice thing about our generic framework for machine learning is that in reality, there is very little difference between how we handle regression and classification problems. Like before, there are hypothesis functions, loss functions, and our goal is still to solve the canonical problem of minimizing the sum of losses on a data set (the only real difference is in the choice of loss function, as we will see even the hypothesis class largely remains the same).\n",

This was historically an important dataset in the intersection of machine learning and health care, and similar subjects are still a topic of very active research.  Of course, 25 years ago, the techniques were much more primitive and computationally less intensive than current approaches to similar problems, but the work has become a classical dataset in machine learning, and also represents a compelling applications.\n",

    "**Background on probabilities:** how does a logistic regression generate these probabilities? The key is a simple transformation of our linear hypothesis function. Remember that our hypothesis function $h_\\theta(x)$ is just a linear combination of our input features and their respective coefficients. The resulting values are represented by the blue line in the plot above. The output from our linear hypothesis function is unbounded, meaning that predicted values can theoretically vary from very positive to very negative numbers. Since we are predicting only two classes, this is not ideal. Instead, what we really want are predictions that are restricted to a range of 0 and 1 - which would enable interpreting the predictions as probabilities. The sigmoid transformation, defined as $1/(1+e^{-h_\\theta(x)})$ does exactly that. We can visualize this using our plot above, but changing the scale of our y-axis to 0 and 1 instead of -1 and 1:"
