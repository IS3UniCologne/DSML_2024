    "\n",
    "1. Simulate the described case by creating a two-dimensional NumPy array with each row representing a student and each column representing a test. Generate random scores for each student and test between 0 and 100, and assign the array to a variable called `student_scores`.\n",
    "2. Oops! You completely forgot Thomas, who joined the class during the school year after the first test. Thomas' score for the second test was 87, and 93 for the third test.\n",
    "    - Since Thomas does not have a score for the first test, you want to simply use the average score of all other students. Calculate this and assign it to a variable called `avg_first_test`. (Hint: array slicing and the function np.mean() might be helpful here)\n",
    "    - Add Thomas using `avg_first_test` as his first test score and his actual second and third test scores to `student_scores`.\n",
    "3. You want to generate the sum of the scores from all three tests for each student. Do this using a matrix multiplication and save the resulting array to a variable called `student_totals`.\n",
    "4. Finally, you want to transform the total scores in `student_totals` to a percentage of maximum available points. Assign this array to a variable called `student_pct`."
