# DSML 2024 Git Repository

Welcome to the official 2024 repository for the course "Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning (DSML)". We will use this space as the central point for sharing code, (small) datasets and instructions with you over the course of this semester.

This repo contains the following:

- [01_Course_Admin_&_Lecture_Slides](01_Course_Admin_&_Lecture_Slides): Link to misc. introductory material including the course syllabus and lecture slides (hosted on ILIAS)
- [02_Workshops](02_Workshops): Code and datasets for workshops

You should check this repo regularly to view and/or download newly released or updated files. If you have experience using git or if you want to learn how to work with a state-of-the-art version control system, you may wish to fork and regularly pull updates to the repository onto your local machine for convenience.
